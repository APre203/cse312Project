Creativity Feature:  
A play sound/play music button has been added to the play page. When this button is clicked on by the user, game music is played. This music can be paused and resumed every time the play sound button is played. Functionality has also been added to make sure that once the music audio file has been played to completion and the audio file has reached the end, the audio loops back and starts playing from the start.
